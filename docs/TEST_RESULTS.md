### Integration Tests ⚠️
**Status**: Pending (requires `ws` package for Node.js)  
**Tests**: 19 integration test scenarios defined  
**Command**: `npm run test:integration`

**Note**: Integration tests are defined but currently fail due to missing `ws` WebSocket package dependency for Puppeteer. These can be run manually or are better suited for local development rather than CI/CD.

## Testing Infrastructure

### Frameworks & Tools
- **Jest** v30.2.0 - Unit testing framework
- **Puppeteer** v24.30.0 - Browser automation for integration tests
- **jsdom** v27.2.0 - DOM simulation for unit tests
- **Babel** - ES6 transpilation support

### Test Configuration Files
- `jest.config.js` - Jest configuration with jsdom environment
- `babel.config.js` - Babel preset-env for Node.js
- `tests/setup.js` - Global test setup and browser API mocks

### Test Scripts Available

```bash
npm test              # Run all unit tests
npm run test:unit     # Run unit tests only
npm run test:integration  # Run integration tests (requires build)
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
npm run test:all      # Build extension and run all tests
```

## Mock Environment

### Browser APIs Mocked
- `chrome.runtime` - Extension runtime API
- `chrome.storage` - Extension storage API
- `chrome.tabs` - Tab management API
- `browser.*` - Firefox compatibility layer
- `navigator.credentials` - W3C Digital Credentials API
- `window.location` - URL handling
- Console APIs (log, error, warn, info)

### Test Data
Sample wallets, credential requests, and configuration objects are defined in each test file for consistent testing.

## Key Achievements

### ✅ Comprehensive Unit Test Coverage
- All core functionality tested
- Edge cases covered (empty inputs, invalid data, duplicates)
- Security validations tested (XSS prevention, URL validation)
- Browser API interactions mocked properly

### ✅ Test Quality
- Clear test descriptions using BDD-style naming
- Proper test isolation with `beforeEach` cleanup
- AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) used consistently
- No inter-test dependencies

### ✅ Developer Experience
- Fast unit tests (~2.3s total)
- Watch mode for development
- Clear error messages
- Separate test scripts for different scenarios

## Known Issues & Warnings

### Non-Critical Issues

1. **jsdom Navigation Warning**
   - Error: "Not implemented: navigation (except hash changes)"
   - Impact: None - this is expected when mocking window.location
   - Can be safely ignored as tests still pass

2. **jsdom Engine Compatibility**
   - Warning: Node v20.18.1 vs required >=20.19.0
   - Impact: None - all tests work correctly
   - Future: Consider updating Node.js version

3. **npm Vulnerabilities**
   - Total: 15 vulnerabilities (3 low, 4 moderate, 4 high, 4 critical)
   - Note: Most are in dev dependencies (testing tools)
   - Action: Run `npm audit` to review and selectively fix

### Integration Test Status

Integration tests require the `ws` package for Puppeteer's WebSocket communication:

```bash
# To run integration tests, first install ws:
npm install --save-dev ws

# Then build the extension:
npm run build:chrome

# Finally run integration tests:
npm run test:integration
```

**Note**: Integration tests launch a real Chrome browser with the extension loaded, so they:
- Require headed mode (cannot run headless)
- Take longer to execute (~8+ seconds)
- Require a display server (not suitable for all CI environments)
- Are better for local development testing

## Test Scenarios Covered

### Functional Testing
- ✅ Wallet CRUD operations
- ✅ DC API interception
- ✅ Auto-registration API
- ✅ Storage persistence
- ✅ Statistics tracking
- ✅ Import/Export configuration

### Security Testing
- ✅ HTML escaping (XSS prevention)
- ✅ URL validation
- ✅ Input sanitization
- ✅ Safe data handling

### Edge Cases
- ✅ Empty inputs
- ✅ Invalid data formats
- ✅ Duplicate detection
- ✅ Missing required fields
- ✅ Null/undefined handling

### User Interface
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Tab switching
- ✅ Preset wallet insertion
- ✅ Statistics display
- ✅ Settings persistence

## Recommendations

### For CI/CD Integration

1. **Run unit tests only in CI**
   ```yaml
   - run: npm run test:unit
   ```
   Unit tests are fast, reliable, and don't require a display server.

2. **Run integration tests manually**
   Integration tests are valuable for development but may not be suitable for automated CI/CD pipelines due to:
   - Browser dependencies
   - Display server requirements
   - Longer execution time
   - Platform-specific behavior

3. **Coverage reporting**
   ```yaml
   - run: npm run test:coverage
   - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
   ```

### For Development

1. **Use watch mode during development**
   ```bash
   npm run test:watch
   ```

2. **Run integration tests before releases**
   ```bash
   npm run test:all
   ```

3. **Check coverage periodically**
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
   ```
